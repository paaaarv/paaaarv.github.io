I went to college at Trinity University in San Antonio and never really found a passion for anything from the classes I took. It was a weird feeling seeing my friends all find their niches and subjects they craved to learn more about, as I did not have that feeling really at all. There were two classes, in hindsight, I remember putting in the most work and enjoying myself the most with - one was a media studies class where I had to do a lot of video compiling and editing and a basic computing class in which we learned the in's and out's of Microsoft Office. I should've realized then that I definitely had an affinity towards working with computers, but what really got me into coding was my older brother. He is a consultant, but in his spare time he likes to code - he created his own website for his wedding just because he thought it would be fun. 


He was the one who told me I should look into coding, that it might be something I would enjoy and boy, was he right. I learned some Python on my own and really enjoyed how it felt like a puzzle that needed to be solved. Finally, I had a cousin who did a bootcamp of his own and recommended Flatiron to me. I ended up signing up for the free course and enjoyed myself so much, solving these puzzles, that I decided to take the leap and commit to the full Web Stack course! 

It's been a whirlwind of emotions, that of frustration, anger, the unrelenting tug of imposter syndrome, etc but there's no high quite like finishing a lab that's taken me forever. It's an amazing feeling finally having it all 'click' and that's what makes me so excited to keep going and finish the course, and more importantly, have this be what I do as a career. It's the first time I've felt really passionate about a subject and I can't wait to see where this road will lead me.
